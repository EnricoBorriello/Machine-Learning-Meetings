## Notes and notebooks for our ML meetings

### ML 01 - Linear Regression
In this notebook we cast the cost function and the gradient of a linear regressor in a vectorized form.
We analitically solve the normal equation for the best fit parameters, and show how the model can be extended to non linear fits.

### ML 02 - Gradient Descent
