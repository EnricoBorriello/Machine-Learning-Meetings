## Notes and notebooks for our ML meetings

### ML 01 - Linear Regression
In this notebook we express the cost function and the gradient of a linear regressor in a vectorized form.
We analitically solve the normal equation for the best fit parameters, and show how the model can be applied to the **non-linear** fit of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> levels over time.

### ML 02 - Gradient Descent
We cast the gradient of a linear regressor in a vectorized form, and test the result of a gradient descent optimization algorithm by comparing our result the analytical solution found in the previous notebook. We review the importance of feature normalization.

### ML 03 - Logistic Regression 1 (warm-up)
This time we cannot derive an analytical solution to test our numerical algorithm. Therefore, we test our classifier on a simple data set with only two features that we can easily visualize.

### ML 04 - Logistic Regression 2
We use the algorithm developed and tested in our previous notebook to reproduce cancer diagnosis classification results found in the medical literature.
