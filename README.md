## Notes and notebooks for our ML meetings

### ML 01 - Linear Regression
In this notebook we express the cost function and the gradient of a linear regressor in a vectorized form.
We analitically solve the normal equation for the best fit parameters, and show how the model can be extended to the non-linear fit of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> levels over time.

### ML 02 - Gradient Descent
We cast the gradient of a linear regressor in a vectorized form, and test the result of gradient descent optimization algorithm by comparing our result the analytical values found in the previous notebook. We review the importance of normalizing the features.

### ML 03 - Logistic regression 1 (warm-up)
This time we cannot derive an analytical solution and test our numerical result. Therefore, we test our code on a simple data set with only two features that we can easily visualize.

### ML 03 - Logistic regression 2
We use the algorithm developed and tested in our previous notebook to reproduce cancer diagnosis classification results found in the medical literature.
